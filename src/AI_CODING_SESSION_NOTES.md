# AI-Augmented Terminal - Coding Session Notes

## 1. Application Purpose

To create a cross-platform desktop terminal application using Electron that allows users to interact with local and remote shells (CMD, PowerShell, bash, SSH). The core feature is an integrated AI assistant (Google Gemini) that can understand user queries, provide help, suggest commands, and, with explicit user approval, execute those commands directly in the active terminal session and interpret their output.

## 2. Core Functionality

*   **Integrated Terminal Emulator**: Standard terminal functionalities, multiple tabs/sessions (tabs are future), local shell connections (CMD, PowerShell, bash/zsh), remote SSH (future).
*   **AI Assistant (Google Gemini)**: Dedicated UI panel for AI interaction, troubleshooting help, command suggestions.
*   **AI Command Execution & Feedback Loop**:
    *   AI proposes commands embedded in its textual response (e.g., within markdown code blocks).
    *   Users can trigger execution of these parsed commands (e.g., via an "Execute" button associated with the command).
*   **Contextual Awareness (Basic)**: AI considers recent (cleaned) terminal history. More advanced context (cwd, shell type) is planned.

**Note for AI Agent:** I will now execute commands directly in the foreground when asked, instead of providing instructions or running them in the background, unless explicitly told otherwise for a specific command.

## 4. Current State & Key Achievements (As of May 10, 2025 - End of Session)

*   **AI Tool Calling Removed**: Successfully removed AI SDK tool-calling functionality. The system now relies on parsing commands from markdown code blocks in the AI's text response.
    *   Updated system prompts to instruct AI to use markdown for commands.
    *   Removed tool definitions from AI API calls (`gemini-chat-manager.ts`).
    *   Deleted `ai-tools.ts`.
    *   Refactored `ai-service.ts`, `gemini-chat-manager.ts`, and related interfaces (`IAiService`, `IChatManager`) to remove tool handling logic.
    *   Updated unit tests (`ai-service.test.ts`) to reflect these changes.
    *   Successfully tested the new approach by running `npm start` and interacting with the AI to list files and get a count.
*   **UI Refactored to React & Tailwind CSS**: The entire renderer process UI uses a React component architecture and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Build System Updated**: Webpack and TypeScript configurations support React (JSX, TSX) and Tailwind CSS.
*   **AI Service Abstraction**: `IAiService` and `IChatManager` interfaces are in place.
*   **Centralized Logger**: `Logger` utility in `src/utils/logger.ts` used in the main process.
*   **Command Output Capturer**: Refactored into `src/main-process/command-output-capturer.ts`.
*   **Text-Based Command Execution**: Users can execute commands parsed from AI's markdown responses.
*   **DaisyUI Integration & UI Enhancements (Previous Session)**:
    *   `SettingsPanelComponent.tsx`: Modal refactored to use `<dialog>`.
    *   `AiPanelComponent.tsx`: Loading spinner added to "Send" button.
    *   `TerminalComponent.tsx`: Dynamic Xterm.js theming based on DaisyUI theme.
*   **Direct API Call for Gemini Model Fetching (Previous Session)**: `settings-ipc.ts` now fetches Gemini models directly via HTTPS, removing SDK dependency for this.
*   **`electron-store` Enhancements (Previous Session)**:
    *   Temporary `as any` cast for TS2339 errors.
    *   Centralized `AppStoreSchemaContents` to `src/interfaces/store-schema.interface.ts`.
*   _(Older achievements still hold: Basic Electron App, Terminal Emulation, AI Chat Interface, Gemini Integration for API key/model selection, initial Feedback Loop, basic Output/History Cleaning, Main Process Refactoring, AI System Prompt enhancements)._

## 5. Pending Tasks & Current Focus

### 5.1. Immediate Focus / Next Steps:

*   **Reliable Command Output Cleaning (Ongoing)**:
    *   **Challenge**: Output from AI-executed commands can still be "messy" (shell prompts, echoed commands).
    *   **Specific Issue**: Backspace (`\b`) character handling in `stripAnsiCodes` (`src/utils/string-utils.ts`) needs verification and potential fixes to prevent malformed strings that break echo removal in `command-output-capturer.ts`.
    *   **Goal**: Improve cleaning logic in `command-output-capturer.ts` to isolate true command output.
*   **AI Chat UI - General Working/Loading Indicator**: Implement a visual indicator in `AiPanelComponent.tsx` (distinct from the send button's spinner) that displays while waiting for a response from the AI service (i.e., during general AI processing for the chat history).
*   **Investigate `electron-store` Typing Issue (High Priority)**: Find a robust, type-safe solution for `electron-store` to replace the `(store as any)` workaround.

### 5.2. Broader Pending Items (from Project Plan):

*   **Full Feedback Loop Refinement**: Ensure Gemini effectively processes cleaned command output for contextual follow-up.
*   **SSH Integration** (Phase 4)
*   **Multiple Tabs/Sessions** (Phase 4)
*   **Enhanced Contextual Awareness for AI** (Phase 4): Send CWD, shell type, etc., to Gemini.
*   **Advanced Settings/Customization** (Phase 4)
*   **Robust Error Handling & UI Polish** (Ongoing)

## 6. Key Learnings & Challenges (Recent & Ongoing)

*   **Removing Tool Calls**: Successfully transitioned to markdown-based command suggestions. This involved careful updates to system prompts, AI service logic, and associated interfaces. Unit tests were crucial for verifying these changes.
*   **Command Output Capturing & Cleaning**: Remains a primary technical challenge. Focus is on `stripAnsiCodes` (especially backspace handling) and improving echo/prompt removal in `command-output-capturer.ts`.
*   **`electron-store` TypeScript Typing**: The `as any` workaround is functional but needs a proper fix for type safety.
*   _(Previous learnings regarding UI refactoring, SDK issues, PTY execution, and React StrictMode are still relevant but have been integrated into the achievements or are considered addressed for now)._

## 7. Session Update (May 10, 2025 - End of Session Summary)

This session focused on removing the AI SDK's tool-calling mechanism for command execution.

### 7.1. Achievements & Changes

*   **Successfully Removed AI Tool Calling**:
    *   Modified the system prompt in `src/main-process/app-store-manager.ts` to instruct the AI to use markdown code blocks for commands and not use tools.
    *   Removed `tools` parameter from `getGenerativeModel` and `startChat` in `src/gemini-chat-manager.ts`.
    *   Updated `src/ai-service.ts`:
        *   Removed `currentToolCallId`.
        *   Modified `processQuery` to only expect text responses (containing markdown commands).
        *   Deleted the `processToolExecutionResult` method.
    *   Updated `src/interfaces/ai-service.interface.ts`:
        *   Removed `processToolExecutionResult` from `IAiService`.
        *   Removed `sendFunctionResponse` from `IChatManager`.
    *   Updated `src/gemini-chat-manager.ts` to remove the `sendFunctionResponse` method.
    *   Deleted the `src/ai-tools.ts` file.
    *   Updated unit tests in `src/tests/unit/ai-service.test.ts` to remove tests related to function calls and tool execution, ensuring all tests pass.
    *   Manually tested the application by running `npm start`:
        *   Confirmed AI suggests commands in markdown.
        *   Confirmed UI parses and allows execution of these commands.
        *   Confirmed command execution and AI understanding of output.
*   **AI Agent Execution Preference Updated**: Noted that the AI (myself) will now execute commands directly in the foreground.

### 7.2. Updated Pending Tasks & Focus (Consolidated)

*   **Reliable Command Output Cleaning**: Top priority, focusing on `stripAnsiCodes` (backspace handling) and `command-output-capturer.ts`.
*   **AI Chat UI - General Working/Loading Indicator**: For `AiPanelComponent.tsx`.
*   **Investigate `electron-store` Typing Issue**: Find a type-safe solution.
*   **Broader Items**: Full feedback loop, SSH, Tabs, Enhanced AI Context, Advanced Settings, Error Handling/Polish.
