# AI-Augmented Terminal - Coding Session Notes

## 1. Application Purpose

To create a cross-platform desktop terminal application using Electron that allows users to interact with local and remote shells (CMD, PowerShell, bash, SSH). The core feature is an integrated AI assistant (Google Gemini) that can understand user queries, provide help, suggest commands, and, with explicit user approval, execute those commands directly in the active terminal session and interpret their output.

## 2. Core Functionality

*   **Integrated Terminal Emulator**: Standard terminal functionalities, multiple tabs/sessions (tabs are future), local shell connections (CMD, PowerShell, bash/zsh), remote SSH (future).
*   **AI Assistant (Google Gemini)**: Dedicated UI panel for AI interaction, troubleshooting help, command suggestions.
*   **AI Command Execution & Feedback Loop**:
    *   AI proposes commands via Gemini Tool Use (`execute_terminal_command`).
    *   Strict user approval before execution.
    *   AI receives the output of the executed command for further analysis or next steps.
*   **Contextual Awareness (Basic)**: AI considers recent (cleaned) terminal history. More advanced context (cwd, shell type) is planned.

## 4. Current State & Achievements (As of May 9, 2025)

*   **UI Refactored to React & Tailwind CSS**:
    *   The entire renderer process UI has been migrated from direct DOM manipulation to a React component architecture (`App.tsx`, `TerminalComponent.tsx`, `AiPanelComponent.tsx`, `SettingsPanelComponent.tsx`).
    *   Styling is now primarily handled by Tailwind CSS, with base styles and Tailwind directives in `styles/`.
*   **Build System Updated**: Webpack and TypeScript configurations updated to support React (JSX, TSX) and Tailwind CSS (PostCSS).
*   **AI Service Abstraction**: Introduced `IAiService` and `IChatManager` interfaces. `AIService` and `GeminiChatSessionManager` implement these, making the AI backend more modular and potentially swappable in the future.
*   **Centralized Logger**: A `Logger` utility (`src/utils/logger.ts`) created and integrated into main process modules for consistent, leveled logging to the npm console.
*   **Command Output Capturer Module**: Logic for capturing and cleaning output from AI-executed commands has been refactored into `src/main-process/command-output-capturer.ts`.
*   **Text-Based Command Execution**: Users can now execute commands parsed from AI's textual responses (markdown code blocks) via an "Execute" button.
*   _(Previous achievements still hold: Basic Electron App, Terminal Emulation, AI Chat Interface, Gemini Integration for API key/model selection, AI Tool Use for command suggestions, initial Feedback Loop, basic Output/History Cleaning, Main Process Refactoring, AI System Prompt enhancements)._

## 5. Pending Tasks & Current Focus

### 5.1. Immediate Focus / Current Challenge:

*   **Reliable Command Output Cleaning (Ongoing)**:
    *   **Challenge**: The output captured from AI-executed commands (via tool calls) and sent back to Gemini is still often "messy". It includes shell prompts, echoed user commands, and echoed marker commands, despite current cleaning heuristics in `command-output-capturer.ts`.
    *   **Specific Issue**: The `stripAnsiCodes` function (now in `src/utils/string-utils.ts` and used by `command-output-capturer.ts`) is not correctly processing backspace (`\b`) characters, leading to malformed strings (e.g., `lsls` from `ls -l` echoes) which then breaks subsequent echo removal logic.
    *   **Goal**: Fix backspace processing in `stripAnsiCodes`. Then, use the detailed debug logs (which are active) to analyze and significantly improve the cleaning logic in `command-output-capturer.ts` to isolate *only* the true output of the executed command.

### 5.2. Broader Pending Items (from Project Plan):

*   **Full Feedback Loop Refinement**: Once output cleaning is reliable, ensure Gemini effectively processes this clean output and provides useful, contextual follow-up.
*   **SSH Integration** (Phase 4): Connect to remote servers.
*   **Multiple Tabs/Sessions** (Phase 4): Allow users to manage multiple terminal sessions.
*   **Enhanced Contextual Awareness for AI** (Phase 4): Send current working directory, shell type, etc., to Gemini.
*   **Advanced Settings/Customization** (Phase 4): More user preferences (default shell, themes, AI behavior).
*   **Robust Error Handling & UI Polish** (Ongoing): Continuously improve stability and user experience.
*   **Investigate `listModels` SDK Issue**: The `@google/generative-ai` SDK's `listModels()` method is not working as expected at runtime (throws "is not a function"). A fallback list is currently used. This might be an SDK version issue or environment interaction.

## 6. Key Learnings, Challenges & Workarounds During Development (Session Specific)

*   **UI Refactoring to React/Tailwind**: Successfully migrated the entire UI to a React component architecture, using Tailwind CSS for styling. This involved setting up the build process (Webpack, PostCSS, tsconfig for JSX) and refactoring all renderer-side JavaScript into `.tsx` components.
*   **`@google/generative-ai` SDK `listModels()` Issue**: (Still relevant) Fallback list is in place.
*   **Command Output Capturing & Cleaning**: (Still relevant) This remains the primary technical challenge. The current focus is on fixing backspace handling in `stripAnsiCodes` and then improving echo/prompt removal.
*   **`electron-store` TypeScript Typing**: (Still relevant) `as any` workaround is still in use.
*   **AI System Prompt Instructions**: (Implemented) Guiding AI for formatted responses.
*   **Code Modularity (Refactoring)**: (Ongoing) Successfully refactored main process, renderer process, and AI service logic into smaller, more maintainable modules. Introduced a shared `utils` directory.
*   **PTY Command Execution (Cross-Platform & PowerShell)**: Identified that sending multi-line commands to PowerShell via a single PTY write can be problematic. Switched to sending the user command and marker command as separate writes for PowerShell. Using `\r` to terminate commands sent via `terminal:input` for better execution simulation.
*   **React StrictMode & `useEffect`**: Encountered and resolved issues with `useEffect` running twice in development (e.g., double PTY creation), addressed by using a global `Set` to track PTY creation requests for `TerminalComponent`.

The next step in the previous session was to test the application after the major React UI refactoring and to analyze the detailed debug logs for command output cleaning, specifically focusing on the backspace handling in `stripAnsiCodes`.

## 7. Session Update (May 10, 2025)

### 7.1. Achievements & Changes

*   **Resolved `electron-store` TypeScript Errors**:
    *   Temporarily addressed TS2339 errors (`Property 'get'/'set' does not exist on type 'Store<AppStoreSchemaContents>'`) by casting the store instance to `any` (i.e., `(store as any).get(...)`) in `src/main-process/ipc-handlers/ai-ipc.ts`, `src/main-process/ipc-handlers/settings-ipc.ts`, and `src/main.ts`. This is a workaround pending a more robust typing solution.
    *   Centralized the `AppStoreSchemaContents` interface into a new file: `src/interfaces/store-schema.interface.ts` to ensure consistency across different parts of the application that interact with `electron-store`.
*   **DaisyUI Integration and Component Refactoring**:
    *   **`SettingsPanelComponent.tsx`**: Refactored the modal implementation to use the HTML `<dialog>` element, controlled via its `showModal()` and `close()` methods. This aligns better with DaisyUI's intended usage for modals and simplifies state management. The previous approach of toggling `modal-open` class was less robust.
    *   **`AiPanelComponent.tsx`**: Enhanced user feedback by adding a loading spinner (DaisyUI `loading` class) to the "Send" button when an AI request is in progress (`isProcessing` state is true).
    *   **`TerminalComponent.tsx`**: Implemented dynamic Xterm.js theming. The terminal theme now updates automatically when the DaisyUI theme changes (e.g., from light to dark). This is achieved by observing the `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element using a `MutationObserver` and applying corresponding Xterm.js theme options.
*   **Application Build and Execution**: Successfully resolved all build-time errors and confirmed the application launches and runs as expected after the aforementioned refactoring and fixes.

### 7.2. Updated Pending Tasks & Focus

*   **Investigate `electron-store` Typing Issue (High Priority)**: Explore a proper long-term solution for the `electron-store` typings to avoid relying on the `(store as any)` workaround. This might involve checking for updated type definitions, custom declaration merging, or alternative ways to interact with the library that are type-safe.
*   **Thorough Testing of New Features**:
    *   Verify the dynamic Xterm.js theming across various DaisyUI themes.
    *   Test the new `<dialog>` based modal in `SettingsPanelComponent.tsx` for correct behavior (opening, closing, content display).
    *   Confirm the loading spinner in `AiPanelComponent.tsx` displays correctly during AI processing.
*   **Reliable Command Output Cleaning (Ongoing)**: This remains a key focus. The previous work on `stripAnsiCodes` and `command-output-capturer.ts` needs to be continued and validated.
*   **SSH Integration** (Phase 4)
*   **Multiple Tabs/Sessions** (Phase 4)
*   **Enhanced Contextual Awareness for AI** (Phase 4)
*   **Advanced Settings/Customization** (Phase 4)
*   **Robust Error Handling & UI Polish** (Ongoing)
*   **Investigate `listModels` SDK Issue** (Lower Priority for now, fallback is working)

### 7.3. Current Code State Summary

*   **Key files modified/created in this session**:
    *   `src/main.ts` (electron-store fix)
    *   `src/main-process/ipc-handlers/ai-ipc.ts` (electron-store fix)
    *   `src/main-process/ipc-handlers/settings-ipc.ts` (electron-store fix)
    *   `src/interfaces/store-schema.interface.ts` (new file for centralized type)
    *   `src/renderer-process/components/App.tsx` (minor adjustments if any for DaisyUI theme propagation)
    *   `src/renderer-process/components/SettingsPanelComponent.tsx` (modal refactor)
    *   `src/renderer-process/components/AiPanelComponent.tsx` (button loading spinner)
    *   `src/renderer-process/components/TerminalComponent.tsx` (dynamic Xterm.js theming, `requestAnimationFrame` for init)

### 7.4. Session Update (May 10, 2025 - Continued)

*   **`SettingsPanelComponent.tsx` Model Dropdown Enhancement**:
    *   Improved the logic for the model selection dropdown to correctly display the `initialModelName` (current `modelName` state) as a selectable option when `availableModels` is empty (e.g., before fetching or if fetching fails but a model was previously set).
    *   Adjusted the `disabled` state of the `select` element to be more intuitive based on loading state and availability of models.
*   **Direct API Call for Gemini Model Fetching**:
    *   Modified `src/main-process/ipc-handlers/settings-ipc.ts` to implement the `settings:fetch-models` IPC handler.
    *   This handler now makes a direct HTTPS `net.request` to the `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key=API_KEY` endpoint to fetch available Gemini models.
    *   The response is parsed, and model names (e.g., `models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) are returned to the renderer process.
    *   This replaces the previous reliance on the AI service/SDK for model listing, aligning with a more AI-agnostic approach for settings UI in the future and addressing the `listModels()` SDK issue directly for Gemini.
*   **`TerminalComponent.tsx` Initialization Refinement**:
    *   Wrapped the core terminal initialization logic within `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure the DOM element is fully rendered and measurable before `xterm.open()` and `fitAddon.fit()` are called. This aims to resolve persistent "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dimensions')" errors.
    *   Added `onHistoryChange` to the `useEffect` dependency array.

*   **Updated Files in this continuation**:
    *   `src/renderer-process/components/SettingsPanelComponent.tsx` (model dropdown logic)
    *   `src/main-process/ipc-handlers/settings-ipc.ts` (direct Google API call for models)
    *   `src/renderer-process/components/TerminalComponent.tsx` (refined initialization with `requestAnimationFrame`)
